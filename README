# engine-O

This is an openGL engine that fuses most of the open source libraries that I
use to learn multimedia programming. I still have a lot to learn about openGL
and graphics programming. As I learn more and more about graphics programming
I will be adding features to this project.

### TODO:
  Implement an intermediate gui like imgui.
  Implement object picking.
  Implement scene graph.
  Implement image, video and audio processing.
